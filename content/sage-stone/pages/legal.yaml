      body: |-
        <p>In these Terms of Supply:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>"The Company"</strong> means Sage & Stone Ltd, registered in England and Wales (Company No. 12345678), with registered office at The Old Joinery, Unit 4, Herefordshire HR4 9AB.</li>
        <li><strong>"The Client"</strong> means the individual or entity commissioning works from the Company.</li>
        <li><strong>"The Works"</strong> means all furniture, joinery, and installation services commissioned by the Client and detailed in the accepted Quotation.</li>
        <li><strong>"The Contract"</strong> means the agreement formed upon the Client's acceptance of the Company's Quotation.</li>
        <li><strong>"The Quotation"</strong> means the written proposal provided by the Company, including specifications, drawings, and pricing.</li>
        </ul>
  - type: "section"
    value:
      anchor: "scope"
      heading: "2. Scope of Works"
      body: |-
        <p>The scope of works is defined exclusively by the accepted Quotation and accompanying drawings. Any variations to the Works must be agreed in writing and may affect the Contract price and completion timeline.</p>

        <p>The Company reserves the right to make minor modifications to designs where necessary for structural integrity or material availability, provided such modifications do not materially affect the overall appearance or function of the Works.</p>

        <h3>In Plain English</h3>
        <p>What's in the quote is what you get. Want changes? No problem--but let's discuss the impact first. If we need to make small tweaks for practical reasons, we'll always explain why.</p>
  - type: "section"
    value:
      anchor: "payment"
      heading: "3. Payment Structure"
      body: |-
        <p>Payment is due in three stages:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>40%</strong> upon acceptance of Quotation (the "Deposit"). This confirms your commission and secures your place in our production schedule.</li>
        <li><strong>40%</strong> upon completion of workshop production, prior to delivery. This covers material costs and workshop time.</li>
        <li><strong>20%</strong> upon completion of installation and final sign-off. This is your quality assurance--we don't consider the job finished until you're completely satisfied.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All payments are due within 14 days of invoice date. The Company reserves the right to charge interest on overdue amounts at 4% above the Bank of England base rate.</p>

        <p>The Deposit is non-refundable once workshop production has commenced, as materials will have been ordered and cut specifically for your commission.</p>

        <h3>In Plain English</h3>
        <p>We don't ask for full payment upfront. You pay as we progress, with the final balance due only when you're completely happy with the finished kitchen. This protects both of us.</p>
  - type: "section"
    value:
      anchor: "materials"
      heading: "4. Living Materials"
      body: |-
        <p>Solid timber is a natural material that continues to respond to its environment throughout its life. The following characteristics are inherent properties of real wood and are not considered defects:</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Seasonal movement:</strong> Timber expands and contracts with changes in humidity. This is normal and anticipated in our joinery details.</li>
        <li><strong>Checking:</strong> Small surface cracks may appear as the wood continues to stabilise. These are cosmetic and do not affect structural integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Colour variation:</strong> Natural variations in grain and colour are part of what makes each piece unique. Timber also changes colour over time with exposure to light.</li>
        <li><strong>Knots and character marks:</strong> Unless specifically requested, we embrace the natural character of the timber, including knots, mineral streaks, and other natural features.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We select and season our timber to minimise these effects, but some degree of natural behaviour should be expected and, we believe, embraced.</p>

        <h3>In Plain English</h3>
        <p>Wood is alive--even after it becomes furniture. Small cracks, colour changes, and seasonal movement are signs of authenticity, not failure. It's what separates real craftsmanship from plastic pretenders. We don't hide from these characteristics; we celebrate them.</p>

    value:
      anchor: "access"
      heading: "5. Access & Logistics"
      body: |-
        <p>The Client agrees to provide:</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear access</strong> to all work areas during agreed installation dates. This includes removing existing furniture, appliances, and personal items from the installation area.</li>
        <li><strong>Reasonable facilities</strong> for our installation team, including access to toilet facilities, running water, and electricity.</li>
        <li><strong>Timely decisions</strong> when variations or unforeseen circumstances arise. Delays in client decisions may affect the project timeline.</li>
        <li><strong>Accurate information</strong> about the property, including any known issues with walls, floors, plumbing, or electrical systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Company will provide reasonable notice of installation dates and will work with the Client to minimise disruption. However, delays caused by lack of access, incomplete preparation, or pending client decisions may result in additional costs and extended timelines.</p>

        <p>Delivery of items is to the nearest accessible point on the ground floor unless alternative arrangements have been agreed and quoted for.</p>

        <h3>In Plain English</h3>
        <p>We need the space clear and ready when we arrive. If something unexpected comes up, quick decisions help us stay on schedule. We'll always work with you to minimise hassle.</p>

    value:
      anchor: "guarantee"
      heading: "6. The Guarantee"
      body: |-

        <h3>In Plain English</h3>
