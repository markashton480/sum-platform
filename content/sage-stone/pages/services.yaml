        - question: "What is the typical lead time for installation?"
          answer: "<p>Installation typically begins 10-12 weeks after design approval, allowing time for material sourcing and workshop production. The installation phase itself takes 2-3 weeks depending on project scope.</p>"
        - question: "Do you install flat-pack kitchens?"
          answer: "<p>No. We only install kitchens built in our Herefordshire workshop. Every piece is crafted specifically for your space--flat-pack has no place in our process.</p>"
        - question: "How do you manage other trades?"
          answer: "<p>We coordinate all required trades including plumbing, electrical, and plastering. Our project director serves as your single point of contact, managing the entire installation timeline.</p>"
