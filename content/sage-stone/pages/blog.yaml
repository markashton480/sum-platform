  excerpt: Why we wait years before a single plank touches our workshop. The ancient practice that separates heirloom furniture
    from firewood.

      body: <p class='lead'>There's a reason antique furniture survives centuries while modern pieces warp within years. The
        secret isn't in the joinery or the finish--it's in the waiting.</p>

      body: <p>When a tree is felled, its wood contains up to 80% moisture. Use it immediately, and you're building with a
        ticking time bomb. As that moisture escapes over months and years, the wood shrinks, twists, and cracks. Every joint
        loosens. Every surface cups.</p><p>This is why we season every piece of timber that enters our workshop. It's also
        why we turn away clients who can't wait.</p>

      body: <p>Freshly cut timber has a moisture content (MC) of 60-80%. For furniture making, we need to bring this down
        to 8-12%--equilibrium with a typical heated home. Get this wrong, and disaster follows.</p><blockquote>Wood remembers.
        Every stress, every rush, every shortcut--it will express them eventually.</blockquote><p>Traditional air drying takes
        approximately one year per inch of thickness. A 2-inch oak board needs two full years before it's ready. Modern kiln
        drying can accelerate this, but at a cost to the wood's character and stability.</p>

        building furniture your grandchildren will use. A few years of patience now prevents decades of problems later.</p><p>We''ve
        had clients ask us to rush. We''ve had competitors promise faster delivery. Both paths lead to the same destination:

        quick turnarounds and competitive pricing. None had asked about their grandparents' kitchen table.</p><p>We did. Because
        that's where the real brief lives.</p><p>It turned out their favourite piece of furniture was a simple oak table,
        handed down through three generations. They wanted their new kitchen to feel like that--permanent, loved, and utterly
        without pretension.</p>

      body: <p>Machine-cut dovetails are perfect. That's the problem.</p><p>When every joint is identical, when every angle
        is exactly 1:8, something essential is lost. The furniture becomes a product, not a piece. It could have been made
        anywhere, by anyone, at any time.</p><p>Hand-cut dovetails are different. Each one carries the signature of its maker--the
        angle they prefer, the saw marks they leave, the tiny variations that accumulate into character.</p>

      body: <p>Beyond aesthetics, hand-cut dovetails offer practical advantages:</p><ul><li><strong>Custom fit:</strong> Each
        joint is cut to match the specific piece of wood, accounting for grain direction and density variations.</li><li><strong>Tighter
        tolerances:</strong> A skilled craftsman can achieve fits that machines cannot, because they can feel when the joint
        is right.</li><li><strong>Repair potential:</strong> Hand-cut joints can be disassembled and repaired. Machine-cut
        joints often cannot.</li></ul>

      body: <p>At Sage & Stone, every drawer box, every carcass joint, every corner is hand-cut. It takes longer. It costs
        more. But sixty years from now, when your grandchildren are cooking in your kitchen, the dovetails will still be tight.</p><p>That's
        the only metric that matters.</p>

        work that came before--and any dust, debris, or moisture that happens to land during application.</p><p>Our new room
        eliminates those risks. Temperature-controlled to within 2C, humidity-regulated, and positively pressured to keep
        dust out. It's overkill for most workshops. For us, it's essential.</p>

      align: left
      body: '<p>The brief was clear: restore what could be saved, replace what couldn''t, and make the joins invisible. No
        one looking at the finished kitchen should be able to tell where the 18th century ends and the 21st begins.</p><p>This
        required research. We spent weeks studying Georgian joinery techniques, visiting museum collections, and consulting
        with conservation specialists. The dovetails of 1783 are subtly different from those we cut today. The moulding profiles
        have changed. Even the way the wood was prepared--its texture, its finish--carries period signatures.</p>'

      body: <p class='lead'>MDF--medium-density fibreboard--is everywhere. It's cheap, stable, and easy to work with. It's
        also the reason most modern kitchens are destined for landfill within twenty years.</p>
  - type: content
    value:
      align: left
      body: <p>The problems with MDF are fundamental:</p><ul><li><strong>Water damage is catastrophic:</strong> Once MDF gets
        wet, it swells and never recovers. Solid timber can be dried and refinished.</li><li><strong>It cannot be repaired:</strong>
        Damaged MDF must be replaced. Damaged timber can be patched, filled, or refinished.</li><li><strong>It has no character:</strong>
        MDF is manufactured uniformity. Timber has grain, colour variation, and warmth.</li><li><strong>It off-gasses:</strong>
        MDF contains formaldehyde resins that continue releasing chemicals for years.</li></ul>

      body: <p>We understand why manufacturers use MDF. It's predictable and profitable. But we're not building for the next
        fiscal quarter--we're building for the next century.</p><p>Every Sage & Stone kitchen is solid timber throughout.
        Carcasses, doors, drawers, shelves--not a scrap of MDF anywhere. It costs more. It takes longer. But it lasts forever.</p><p>That's
        a trade we'll make every time.</p>
