# **[DOC-001]: Documentation Coverage, Hygiene & Link Integrity Audit**

## **Objective**

Ensure the SUM Platform repository has **clear, accurate, and navigable documentation** for:

* developers working on the platform
* developers *consuming* `sum_core`
* future-you returning after context decay

This task is about **coverage, correctness, and linkage**, not verbosity.

---

## **Context**

Milestones 0–4 have produced a large amount of **high-quality but distributed documentation**, including:

* SSOT / PRD
* Wiring inventory
* Hygiene guidelines
* CORE audit reports
* Milestone transcripts and release review

At this point:

* the platform is shippable
* behaviour is correct
* but documentation risks becoming fragmented unless intentionally consolidated

This task ensures the docs now reflect **what actually exists**, and that there is a **clear entry point and navigation path** through them.

---

## **In Scope**

### 1. **Documentation Inventory & Coverage Audit**

Perform an audit of all existing documentation and answer:

* What docs exist?
* Who are they for?
* Are there gaps for:

  * contributors (DX)
  * core consumers (client projects / you)
  * operational understanding (health, observability, integrations)?

Deliverable:

* A short inventory table (doc → audience → purpose).

---

### 2. **README as Canonical Entry Point**

Update `README.md` so it clearly answers:

1. What is SUM Platform?
2. What is `sum_core`?
3. Who should read what next?

Specifically ensure README links to:

* SSOT / PRD
* Wiring Inventory
* Hygiene guidelines
* How to run tests / lint
* Smoke consumer project (what it proves, not how to use it in depth)

The README should **not** duplicate content — only route people correctly.

---

### 3. **Developer Experience (DX) Docs Check**

Ensure the following are:

* present
* accurate
* linked from somewhere sensible

Items to verify:

* `docs/dev/hygiene.md`
* daily code review guidance
* end-of-milestone review expectations
* how to run the test suite
* how to add a new core feature (at a high level)

If something exists but is buried, link it.
If something is missing but obvious, add a short doc stub.

---

### 4. **Core Consumer Documentation**

Ensure a developer consuming `sum_core` can answer:

* What apps must I add to `INSTALLED_APPS`?
* What URLs must I include?
* What settings / env vars are required vs optional?
* What features are “on by default” vs opt-in?

This should primarily:

* point to `WIRING-INVENTORY.md`
* ensure that inventory is accurate and discoverable

No need to rewrite the inventory — just validate and integrate it.

---

### 5. **Link Integrity & Drift Check**

Systematically check:

* internal markdown links
* relative paths
* references to moved/renamed files

Fix:

* broken links
* outdated filenames
* references to superseded docs

No external link checking required beyond obvious things.

---

### 6. **Docs Hygiene**

Lightweight cleanup only:

* consistent headings
* obvious typos
* outdated “TODO” markers (either remove or clarify)

Do **not** rewrite tone or over-polish.

---

## **Explicitly Out of Scope**

* Writing tutorials
* Marketing docs
* Full “getting started” guides
* Boilerplate/CLI docs (that’s M5)
* API reference documentation

If something belongs to M5, note it clearly and move on.

---

## **Implementation Guidelines**

* Prefer **linking over duplicating**
* Treat docs as part of the platform contract
* Keep changes reviewable (small commits, clear intent)
* If unsure where something belongs, add a short note rather than invent structure

---

## **Deliverables**

1. Updated `README.md`
2. Any new or updated docs under `docs/` (minimal, purposeful)
3. **DOC-001 report** filed under `docs/dev/DOC/DOC-001_followup.md` summarising:

   * what was checked
   * what was changed
   * known doc gaps deferred to M5+

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**

* [ ] README provides a clear navigation map for the repo
* [ ] All key docs are discoverable via links
* [ ] Wiring inventory is accurate and referenced
* [ ] Hygiene and DX expectations are documented and linked
* [ ] No broken internal links remain
* [ ] Documentation reflects the *actual* state of Milestones 0–4

---

## **Estimated Complexity**

* **Time:** S–M
* **Risk:** Low
* **Value:** High (reduces cognitive load and future rework)
