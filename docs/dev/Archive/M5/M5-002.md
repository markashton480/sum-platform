## **[M5-002]: Create `/boilerplate/` by formalising `sum_client` as the canonical template**

**Objective**: Turn `clients/sum_client/` into the **copyable boilerplate** that `sum init` will use—without adding automation yet. This establishes the “factory template” for real client sites.

### Context (from SSOT/README)

- M5 deliverables include a **client boilerplate**, `.env.example`, template override structure, and deployment/infrastructure templates.
- README explicitly lists `boilerplate/` as currently a placeholder and positions client projects under `/clients/<client-name>/`.
- CLI later copies from boilerplate into `clients/<project-name>/`.

### Technical Requirements

- Create `/boilerplate/` as a **clean, copy-ready** version of `sum_client`:

  - No hard-coded project name that would break renaming (use obvious placeholders where needed).
  - Keep settings split (`base/local/production`) and URL wiring intact.
  - Keep template/static override directories in place.

- Add `/boilerplate/.env.example` covering the _actual_ env vars a deployed client needs (DB, allowed hosts, email, redis/celery, sentry optional). Base it on what `sum_core` expects.
- Add `/boilerplate/README.md` explaining:

  - What the boilerplate is for
  - How to run it locally
  - What must be changed per client (hosts, secret key, branding, etc.)

### Implementation Guidelines

- Files to create/modify (high level):

  - `boilerplate/` (new)
  - `boilerplate/.env.example` (new)
  - `boilerplate/README.md` (new)
  - Optional: `docs/dev/WIRING-INVENTORY.md` update if it references the old smoke consumer/test project flows (only if needed)

- Ensure boilerplate has **no references to `sum_client` as a fixed name** in places that will cause confusion after copy (settings module path is the main trap—decide a placeholder strategy now, even before the CLI exists).

### Acceptance Criteria

- `boilerplate/` exists and is a runnable project **when copied** to `clients/<name>/` and minimally search/replace’d per instructions.
- `.env.example` is present and accurate for a VPS deployment baseline.
- Boilerplate includes template/static override structure.
- No accidental dependency on `test_project`.

### Testing Requirements (per test strategy)

- Add at least one minimal integration test (like the health test) that will continue to pass once copied, to keep boilerplate from rotting. Keep it non-brittle.

### Estimated Complexity

- Time: **M**
- Risk: **Medium** (naming/paths, keeping copyability)
- Suggested model: **GPT-5.2 Thinking** (because project-template edge cases are sneaky)
