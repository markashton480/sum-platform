**[CM-002]: Dashboard Panel Contract Guardrail**

**Objective**: Prevent regressions where Wagtail admin dashboard panels break `/admin/` due to missing required panel attributes (e.g. `.media`).

**Scope**

- Add a regression test that instantiates `LeadAnalyticsPanel` and asserts:

  - it has a `.media` attribute
  - `.media` is a `django.forms.Media` instance (or at least truthy / Media-like)

- Optional: add a tiny smoke test that constructs homepage panels via the hook and ensures no attribute errors are raised when accessing `.media`.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- `/admin/` panel aggregation contract is protected by tests.
- `make test` passes.

That’s it — quick, auditable, and it turns this “Wagtail footgun” into something we won’t trip over again.
