**[M6-CM-001]: Harden VPS golden path against socket/Caddy misconfig**

* **Objective**: Make the runbook + templates resilient to the two most common first-deploy failures: unix socket permissions and Caddy include-path assumptions.
* **Changes**

  1. Update `infrastructure/systemd/sum-site-gunicorn.service.template` to enforce socket readability by Caddy (`UMask=0007` or `--umask 007`).
  2. Update `infrastructure/docs/vps-golden-path.md` to explicitly ensure the main `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` imports `/etc/caddy/sites-enabled/*.caddy` (or switch the approach to editing the main file directly).
  3. Minor wording clarity in the runbook around user/group ownership for the socket.
* **Acceptance criteria**

  * Fresh VPS deploy works after **reboot** (Caddy can still connect to gunicorn).
  * Caddy definitely loads the site config (no “file exists but not imported” scenario).
  * `/health/` returns expected status codes (200 for ok/degraded; 503 for unhealthy) after deploy.
