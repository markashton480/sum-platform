## Summary

**Direction: ✅ Correct.** `seed_showroom` gives you a repeatable baseline that showcases essentially the whole block catalogue across multiple page contexts (home, showroom, services index, service pages, contact), plus navigation + branding data so headers/footers/forms can render realistically.

That’s exactly what you need to break out of “old face, new skin”: now you can rewrite block templates to match Sage & Stone markup skeleton and see the impact immediately.

## Strengths

- **Lives in boilerplate** (not `sum_core`) because it depends on the _client-owned_ `HomePage` model — that’s a good boundary.
- **Idempotent intent**: re-running overwrites seeded content to the baseline and ensures nav/branding exists.
- **Covers real rendering edges**:

  - images (chooser blocks)
  - nav settings + effective footer fallback behaviour
  - forms embedded on service pages
  - legacy “hero” block preserved for compatibility

- **Placeholder images generation** is pragmatic and makes template iteration much less annoying.
- Good docs + boilerplate sync instructions (`make sync-cli-boilerplate`, etc).

## Required changes before I’d merge this into “trusted tooling”

### 1) `--clear` deletion is too dangerous as written

Right now it deletes by slug globally:

```py
ServicePage.objects.filter(slug=slug).delete()
```

That can absolutely delete real user content if someone happens to have a `roofing` slug elsewhere.

**Fix:** scope deletion to the seeded subtree _only_. The safest pattern is:

- identify the seeded home (by expected slug, or by a stored “seed marker”)
- only delete descendants of that page
- delete via Wagtail’s page deletion (see next point)

### 2) Use Wagtail page deletion, not queryset `.delete()`

QuerySet `.delete()` can bypass per-instance hooks/cleanup (search index, signals, etc.). For Wagtail pages you generally want `.specific.delete()` per page.

So: iterate and delete pages as `Page` objects within the showroom subtree.

### 3) Don’t overwrite “first HomePage” by default

This line is a footgun in any non-fresh project:

```py
existing = home_page_model.objects.first()
if existing:
    home = existing
```

Then you proceed to overwrite `home.body`, set it as the site root, etc.

**Fix:** only reuse an existing HomePage if it matches the showroom slug (or has an explicit marker). Otherwise create a new showroom homepage (or require `--force` to repoint the default site).

This is especially important because your docs claim it “does not attempt to delete arbitrary user-created content” — but the current behaviour can absolutely trample it.

### 4) HomePage model resolution: minor correctness

This condition is probably wrong:

```py
if app_config.label == "home" or app_config.label.endswith(".home"):
```

`label` won’t normally contain dots. If you want to match dotted paths, use `app_config.name.endswith(".home")`.

Not catastrophic, but easy to correct.

## Suggested improvements (high leverage, not mandatory)

### A) Add a “single-page kitchen sink” too

Spreading blocks across pages is great for realism, but for **template iteration speed**, one long `/showroom/` that includes _everything_ is often faster.

You can keep the distributed pages, but add an extra `StandardPage` slug like `kitchen-sink` that contains _all blocks_ in a stable order. Your docs already articulate the “show all blocks” intent; this just optimises the dev loop.

### B) Create a dedicated Wagtail Collection for showroom images

Right now images go into the root collection. It’s fine, but messy. You can create/use a `Collection` called “Showroom” and store all generated images there, so deleting/cleaning is easy.

### C) Put a “seed marker” in one place

E.g. a SiteSettings field like `showroom_seed_version` or a hidden page field, so the command can:

- detect “this project already has seeded showroom content”
- refuse to overwrite unless `--force`
- clear safely

### D) Tests: minimal integration test is worth it

Given this is automation that mutates content, a small test suite pays off (especially with AI-generated changes). The test strategy explicitly wants behavioural changes validated + covered.

Even 1–2 tests that run the command and assert:

- it creates pages with expected slugs under the showroom home
- it seeds nav settings without crashing
- it’s idempotent (second run doesn’t duplicate pages)

…would prevent nasty regressions.
