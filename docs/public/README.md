# SUM Core (Public)

This folder contains documentation that is safe to publish to the public
distribution repository (`markashton480/sum-core`).

The private development repository (`markashton480/sum-platform`) syncs this
folder to the public repo at release time:

- `docs/public/**` → `docs/**` in `sum-core`

If you're looking for private/internal documentation, see `docs/dev/`.
